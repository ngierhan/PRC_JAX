# PRC_JAX
[In Progress] Simulation and Optimization of Physical Reservoir Computer

Note: Linux OS is required to run parallelized code on GPU
JAX Installation: https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html 

FILES:

_1DPRC_JAX_CPUandGPU_V1.py_: Runs simulation of 1D PRC on CPU or GPU

_OPT_1DPRC_JAX_V1.py_: Runs parallel simulation and optimization of 1D PRCs on GPU (GPU is default, can also run on CPU)

***_NOTE_: Uncomment indicated code sections for the most accurate performance timing.
